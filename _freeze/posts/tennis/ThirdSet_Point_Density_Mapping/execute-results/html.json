Following this, we can carry out various forms of additional analysis (such as [mapping drive distances](https://sturbull.github.io./posts/tennis/SecondSet_Drive_Isodistances.html).\n\nIn this next post, I'll show you how you can take any set of points with coordinates, and make a heat map across an area showing the density of points. This post is heavily inspired by work carried out by Andrew Heiss, check out his work [here](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2023/07/28/gradient-map-fills-r-sf/). the following post is very much an adaptation of his work!\n\nUsing density functions, we can visualise hot and cold spots across our desired area. In our case, we will be using the density point maps to understand which areas of Auckland have the greatest/least number of tennis clubs. As a first step, we're going to load up the tennis club data. The code below will load our data in. For information on how this data was orinally source, see my post on [webscraping and geocoding](https://sturbull.github.io./posts/tennis/FirstSet_Webscraping_and_GeoCoding.html)!\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(reactable)\ndf <- read.csv(here(\"inputs\",\"tennis\",\"tennis_coords.csv\"))\n\n#We know the geocoding failed on some addresses, so we'll exclude those\ndf_clean <- df |>\n  filter(!is.na(latitude) | !is.na(longitude)) \n\ndf_clean |> \n  head() |>\n  reactable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"reactable html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-0d9f82fc5aaaa0d3ad99\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-0d9f82fc5aaaa0d3ad99\">{\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"name\":[\"Next Generation Auckland Domain\",\"Pompallier Lawn Tennis Club\",\"Ngatira Tennis Club\",\"Gladstone Tennis Club\",\"Herne Bay Ponsonby Rackets Club\",\"Mt Eden Tennis Club\"],\"storepoint_address\":[\"1 Tennis Lane Parnell, Auckland,  1010, New Zealand\",\"11 Green Street Ponsonby,  1011, New Zealand\",\"24 Clive Road Mount Eden,  1024, New Zealand\",\"120 Gladstone Road Parnell, Auckland,  1052, New Zealand\",\"10 West End Road Herne Bay,  1022, New Zealand\",\"22 Poronui Street Mount Eden,  1024, New Zealand\"],\"latitude\":[-36.8543941,-36.8461653,-36.8728163,-36.8496888,-36.8494279,-36.8832081],\"longitude\":[174.7723731,174.7464657,174.7663288,174.7858216,174.7303048,174.7649894]},\"columns\":[{\"id\":\"name\",\"name\":\"name\",\"type\":\"character\"},{\"id\":\"storepoint_address\",\"name\":\"storepoint_address\",\"type\":\"character\"},{\"id\":\"latitude\",\"name\":\"latitude\",\"type\":\"numeric\"},{\"id\":\"longitude\",\"name\":\"longitude\",\"type\":\"numeric\"}],\"dataKey\":\"c696adcc55735c3f21083957d5b8f0fd\"},\"children\":[]},\"class\":\"reactR_markup\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Mapping\nTo map our data, we will just need a shapefile with the map for Auckland, and the data with the coordinates of the tennis clubs in that area. We'll load that up now. \n\n## Load the shape file for Auckland Central.\nThis is will be our map layer, showing where Auckland is.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nnz_sf <- read_sf(here(\"inputs\", \"shapefiles\", \"NZ_res01.shp\")) \n\n# Get the coordinates for Auckland in WGS84\nauckland_coords <- matrix(\n  c(\n    174.5, -37.0,  # min x, min y (SW corner)\n    174.95, -37.0,  # max x, min y (SE corner)\n    174.95, -36.7,  # max x, max y (NE corner)\n    174.5, -36.7,  # min x, max y (NW corner)\n    174.5, -37.0   # closing point (SW corner)\n  ), \n  ncol = 2,\n  byrow = TRUE\n)\n\n# Create a POLYGON from the bounding box and set CRS to WGS84\nauckland_polygon <- st_polygon(list(auckland_coords)) |> \n  st_sfc(crs = 4326) \n\nauckland_sf <- nz_sf |> \n  # Intersect the Auckland shapefile with the Auckland bounding box\n  st_intersection(auckland_polygon) |>\n  st_transform(crs = 2193) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## 2: We need to get our tennis club location data\nWe'll need to make sure it's in the same format and CRS.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#clean point df and put to sf\npoint_sf <- df_clean |>\n  st_as_sf(\n    coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n    crs = 4326\n  ) \n\npoint_sf_auckland <- point_sf |>\n  st_intersection(auckland_polygon) |>\n  st_transform(crs = 2193) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nAs mentioned in [Andrew Heiss's blog post](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2023/07/28/gradient-map-fills-r-sf/), we need to ensure that the coordinate reference system is one that uses metres. This is why I've set each of `sf` objects to have crs 2193 (New Zealand Transverse Mercator (NZTM)).\n\n# Density by Grids\nNow we have our base map and the tennis location data, we can look at visualising our point density. There's a couple of useful ways we can show this data. The first will look at gridding the Auckland region up in to areas of equal size. \n\nFirst up, we will split our map of Auckland into a 10X10 grid using the code below, and trim our grid so it only includes sections that overlap the auckland area. To accomplish this, we'll use the `st_intersection` function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n#Split Auckland into a 10X10 Grid\nauckland_grid <- auckland_sf %>% \n  st_make_grid(n = c(10, 10))\n\n\nauckland_grid_map <- st_intersection(auckland_sf, auckland_grid) %>% \n  st_as_sf() %>% \n  mutate(grid_id = 1:n())\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = auckland_grid_map) +\n  theme_void()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ThirdSet_Point_Density_Mapping_files/figure-html/grid-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can then fill each section of the grid according to the number of points that fall within each section. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclub_per_grid_box <- auckland_grid_map %>% \n  st_join(point_sf_auckland) %>% \n  group_by(grid_id) %>% \n  summarise(total = sum(!is.na(storepoint_address)))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = club_per_grid_box, aes(fill = total), color = NA) +\ngeom_sf(\n    data = point_sf_auckland, \n    color = 'black',\n    fill=\"#ccff00\",\n    shape=21,\n    size=3,\n    alpha=0.9\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\"Total\\nTennis\\nClubs\", option = \"D\") +\ntheme_void() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ThirdSet_Point_Density_Mapping_files/figure-html/grid_fill-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Density Gradient\nYou can see on the previous map that a couple of the grid sections had low values, but were actually quite close to a few tennis clubs. A different way to show the density of points that can account for this is to use a gradient fill. In basic terms, this takes our 10X10 grid and ramps it up. With this, we have a map that fills according to a density, rather than a distinct categorical count for each section. The result will be a map with a smoother looking fill. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(spatstat)\nlibrary(stars)\nauckland_ppp <- as.ppp(point_sf_auckland$geometry, W = as.owin(auckland_sf))\ndensity_auckland_stars <- st_as_stars(density(auckland_ppp, dimyx = 300))\nauckland_density <- st_as_sf(density_auckland_stars) %>%\n  st_set_crs(2193)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Plotting\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = auckland_sf,\n    alpha = 1,\n    fill=\"black\",\n    colour=\"black\",\n    linewidth=0.2\n  ) +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = auckland_density,\n    aes(fill = v), \n    color = NA,\n    alpha = 1,\n    linewidth=0.1\n  ) +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = point_sf_auckland, \n    color = 'black',\n    fill=\"#ccff00\",\n    shape=21,\n    size=3,\n    alpha=0.9\n  ) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    legend.title = element_blank(),\n    legend.spacing = unit(0,\"lines\"),\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size=20),\n    title = element_text(size=20)\n  ) +\n    scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"D\") +\n   coord_sf(crs = 4326,\n    xlim = c(174.6, 174.95),\n    ylim = c(-37, -36.72)\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Point Density of\\nAuckland Tennis Clubs\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ThirdSet_Point_Density_Mapping_files/figure-html/plot-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nBoth the gridded and density point maps provide a really easy way to visualise hot and cold spots across a map in terms of specific coordinates. In our case, we can clearly see how tennis clubs are clustered around the centre of Auckland, becoming more sparse in the outer suburbs. \n\nAgain, I'd like to point to Andrew Heiss's blog post on this method, he goes into a lot more detail, and makes it super accessible to pick up and adapt the code (as I've done here).
